# Dev Agent Manifest ‚Äî Mountain Medicine Catering

This file defines agent roles, responsibilities, file ownership, and communication protocols for this repo. It is used by Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT as a shared contract.

## üß† Architecture Summary

The app is migrating from a Streamlit-based UI to a fully Firebase-hosted frontend using React (or Svelte), Firebase Auth, Firestore, and Cloud Functions.

Firebase Hosting will serve the app shell (`index.html`), React components, and static files.

## üß± Stack Overview

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (or Svelte) hosted via Firebase Hosting
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js preferred)
- **Database**: Firestore (users, recipes, events, files, tags, etc.)
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Google sign-in + token persistence)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for file uploads
- **AI**: OpenAI API via Cloud Function middleware

## üß† Agent Roles

### Architect Agent (ChatGPT, Claude)

- Decomposes high-level feature specs
- Defines module structure and component ownership
- Maintains this file

### Builder Agent (Codex, GPT-4 Code Interpreter)

- Writes and modifies:
  - React components
  - Firebase functions
  - Firestore queries
  - Utility scripts
- Obeys file boundaries from Architect Agent

### Memory Agent

- Indexes file structure and API surface
- Resolves inter-component dependencies
- Maintains shared context state in memory or `filemap.json`

### Executor Agent (Optional)

- Uses CLI tools to:
  - Run `firebase deploy`
  - Run `npm run dev`
  - Build local functions with `esbuild` or `tsc`
  - Output logs to `/logs`
